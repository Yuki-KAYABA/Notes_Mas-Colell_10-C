# Notes: Mas-Colell 10.C Partial Equilibrium Competitive Analysis
Personal notes of partial equilibrium competitive analysis

Partial equiliburium analysis is justified by the following reasons:
- When the expenditure on the good under study is a small portion of a counsumer's total expenditure, only a small fraction of any additional doller of wealth will be spent on this good; consequently, we can expect wealth effects for it to be small.
- With similarly dispersed substitution effects, the small size of the market under study shiould lead the prices of other goods to be appoximately unaffected by changes in this market.
